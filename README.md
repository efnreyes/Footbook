NSFetchedResultsController

UITableView expects its data source to provide cells as an array of sections made up of rows. You configure a fetch results controller using a fetch request that specifies the entity, an array containing at least one sort ordering, and optionally a filter predicate. The fetched results controller efficiently analyzes the result of the fetch request and computes all the information about sections in the result set. It also computes all the information for the index based on the result set. Read more in the Apple docs.


As a user, I want to add the people whose feet I like to my Footbook
3 points

    The main screen of the app is a list of people whose feet the user likes.
    These people have feet: http://s3.amazonaws.com/mobile-makers-assets/app/public/ckeditor_assets/attachments/4/friends.json allow the user to choose whose feet they like
        ​hint the choice screen is a separate screen and should be segue'd from the first screen!
    Supplement the JSON: give each person a random number of feet (less than 100 please: we’re not centipedes), add at least two other attributes (eg. shoe-size, hairiness…)
